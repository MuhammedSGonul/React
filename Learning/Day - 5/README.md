Today for the first time I revived the project on a project [Day - 4](https://github.com/MuhammedSGonul/React/tree/main/Learning/Day%20-%204) using javascript. In this project I made a library application using localStorage. 
Adding and deleting books to the library is done. Added books are stored in localStorage.
